# Voluntary validator exit

Ethereum 2.0 has a concept of "voluntary validator exit", which will remove the
validator from attesting duties. Locked Eth could be withdrawn after the "merge"
of Ethereum 2.0 with Ethereum 1, and not sooner.

Currently, Prysm, Lighthouse and Nimbus support voluntary exit. This requires a fully synced
beacon node.

## Prysm

To exit, run `sudo docker-compose run --rm validator-voluntary-exit` and follow the
prompts.

If you wish to exit validators that were running on other clients, you can do this
as follows:

- Stop the other client(s), and wait 10 minutes. This is so you won't have
  a validator attest in the same epoch twice.
- Copy all `keystore-m` JSON files into `.eth2/validator_keys` in this project
  directory.
- Stop the Prysm client in this project, `sudo docker-compose down`
- Import the new keys via `sudo docker-compose run validator-import`. Note
  that Prysm assumes they all have the same password. If that's not the case,
  maybe work in batches.
- Verify once more that the old client is down, has been for 10 minutes, and
  can't come back up. **If both the old client and this Prysm run at the same time,
  you will slash yourself**
- Bring the Prysm client up: `sudo docker-compose up -d eth2`
- Check logs until the beacon is synced: `sudo docker-compose logs -f beacon`
- Initiate voluntary exit and follow the prompts: `sudo docker-compose run --rm validator-voluntary-exit`


## Lighthouse

The exit procedure for lighthouse is not very refined, yet.

- Copy the `keystore-m` JSON files into `.eth2/validator_keys` in this project
  directory.
- Run `sudo docker-compose run --rm validator-voluntary-exit /var/lib/lighthouse/validator_keys/<name-of-keystore-file>`,
  once for each keystore (validator) you wish to exit.
- Follow prompts.

> The directory `.eth2/validator_keys` is passed through to docker as `/var/lib/lighthouse/validator_keys`. Lighthouse
> expects you to explicitly name the `keystore-m` file for which you wish to process an exit. Because this can
> be confusing, here's an example:
```
yorick@ethlinux:~/eth2-pyrmont$ ls .eth2/validator_keys/
deposit_data-1605672506.json  keystore-m_12381_3600_0_0_0-1605672506.json
yorick@ethlinux:~/eth2-pyrmont$ sudo docker-compose run --rm validator-voluntary-exit /var/lib/lighthouse/validator_keys/keystore-m_12381_3600_0_0_0-1605672506.json
Starting eth2-pyrmont_beacon_1 ... done
Running account manager for pyrmont testnet
validator-dir path: "/var/lib/lighthouse/validators" 
Enter the keystore password for validator in "/var/lib/lighthouse/validator_keys/keystore-m_12381_3600_0_0_0-1605672506.json"  
```

## Nimbus

You will need to know the index of your validator as it shows on https://beaconcha.in/ or https://pyrmont.beaconcha.in/ if on Pyrmont testnet, or its public key.

Run `sudo docker-compose run --rm validator-voluntary-exit <INDEX or 0xPUBKEY>` and follow prompts to exit. For example:
- If using an index, here 0, `sudo docker-compose run --rm validator-voluntary-exit 0`
- If using a public key, you need to include "0x" in front of it, for example `sudo docker-compose run --rm validator-voluntary-exit 0xb0127e191555550fae82788061320428d2cef31b0807aa33b88f48c53682baddce6398bb737b1ba5c503ca696d0cab4a`

## Avoid penalties

Note you will need to continue running your validator until the exit
has been processed by the chain, if you wish to avoid incurring offline
penalties. You can check the status of your validator with tools such
as [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in) and [beaconscan](https://beaconscan.com).
