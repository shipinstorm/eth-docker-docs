Windows may seem like an "easy button". For eth2-docker, it is anything but, and even for
other ways of running a client, there are multiple challenges. They can all be overcome,
and the [eth2 validator wizard project](https://github.com/stake-house/eth2-validator-wizard) aims
to do just that.

Things to think about with Windows:

- Time sync out of the box on not domain-joined Windows can be so badly "off" you can't attest. To improve this:
  - Change w32time to [start automatically](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/identity/w32time-not-start-on-workgroup). In Administrator cmd, but **not** PowerShell, `sc triggerinfo w32time start/networkon stop/networkoff`. Verify with `sc qtriggerinfo w32time`. To get into cmd that way, you can start Admin PowerShell and then just type `cmd`.
  - Make a few changes in regedit. 
    - In `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\w32time\Config`, set `MaxPollInterval` to hex `c`, decimal `12`.
    - Check `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\w32time\Parameters\NtpServer`. If it ends in `0x9` you are done. If it ends in `0x1` you need to adjust `SpecialPollInterval` in `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\w32time\TimeProviders\NtpClient` to read `3600`
  - Reboot, then from Powershell run `w32tm /query /status /verbose` to verify that w32time service did start. If it didn't, check triggers again. If all else fails, set it to Automatic Delayed startup
- Time sync in WSL2 requires a kernel fix, which should be available around H2 2021. Windows 10 20H2 or newer is required.
- Your node needs to run as a service for 24/7 uptime and security - user should not need to be logged in for node to run. How to differs between Docker Desktop
  and other ways of running. You'd be looking into Windows Task Scheduler.
- Client diversity. Prysm does Windows-native, Lighthouse may as well. The other two would rely on a setup that runs them in Docker Desktop and WSL2,
  thus Linux, afaik.
- eth1 node - Prysm sidesteps this with 3rd-party, and Geth runs natively. For other clients, you're looking at Docker Desktop again.
- Remote administration - SSH? RDP? If RDP, do you need a "proper" cert to encrypt?
- If using Docker Desktop and WSL2, consider that WSL2 runs as a virtual network. Work-around is to run a Powerscript that addresses needed port-forwarding.
- I've had Docker Desktop fail to start, rarely. It appears to be related to when there is an update available, which would typically be the case
  upon restart of the host. This needs to be solved, I am not sure how.

The best bet for Windows is likely to run Prysm or Teku natively, with Geth, some way of starting them as a service without a user needing to be logged
in (Task Scheduler), and improved time sync.
