For reference, here are disk, RAM and CPU requirements, as well as mainnet initial
synchronization times, for different Ethereum 1 clients.

PRs to add to this information welcome.

## Disk, RAM, CPU requirements

SSD, RAM and CPU use is after initial sync, when keeping up with head. 100% CPU is one core.

| Client | Version | Date | DB Size  | DB Growth | RAM | CPU | Notes |
|--------|---------|----  |----------|-----------|-----|-----|-------|
| OpenEthereum | Nov 2020 | 3.1.0rc1 | ~380 GiB | ~ 3.5 GiB / week | 1 GiB | 100-300% | DB grows with chain, prunes itself |
| Geth   | 1.10.1 | Mar 2021 | ~350 GiB | ~ 10 GiB / week | 9 GiB | 100-400% | DB size can be reduced by offline(!) prune with `docker-compose run --rm eth1 snapshot prune-state` |
| Nethermind | 1.10.46 | Mar 2021 | ~170 GiB | TBD | 14 GiB | 100-400% | memory use w/ pruning and prune-cache 2048; initial size lower bcs of ancient barrier |
| Besu | v20.10.2 | Dec 2020 | ~420 GiB | ~ 78 GiB / week | 6 - 9 GiB | 200-300% | |

## Test Systems

IOPS is random read-write IOPS [measured by fio with "typical" DB parameters](https://arstech.net/how-to-measure-disk-performance-iops-with-fio-in-linux/).

A note on Contabo: Stability of their service [is questionable](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/l5d69l/if_youre_struggling_with_contabo/).

| Name                 | RAM    | SSD Size | CPU        | IOPS | Notes |
|----------------------|--------|----------|------------|------|-------|
| Homebrew Xeon        | 32 GiB | 700 GiB  | Intel Quad | 18.3k read / 6.1k write | Xeon E3-2225v6 |
| Dell R420            | 32 GiB | 1 TB     | Dual Intel Octo | 28.9k read / 9.6k write | Xeon E5-2450 |
| Contabo M/L VPS        | 16/30 GiB | 400/800 GiB  | Intel Hexa/Octa  | 3k read / 1k write | Xeon E5-2630 v4 - some Contabo VPS are AMD |
| [Netcup](https://netcup.eu) VPS 2000/3000 G9   | 16/24 GiB | 320/600 GiB  | AMD Quad/Hexa | 46.4k read / 15.5k write | |

## Initial sync times

NB: All eth1 clients need to [download state](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/20938#issuecomment-616402016)
after getting blocks. If state isn't "in" yet, your sync is not done. This is a heavily disk IOPS dependent
operation, which is why HDD cannot be used for a node. For Nethermind, seeing "branches" percentage reset to "0.00%"
after state root changes with "Setting sync state root to" is normal and expected. With sufficient IOPS, the
node will "catch up" and get in sync.

| Client | Version | Date | Test System | Time Taken | Cache Size | Notes |
|--------|---------|------|-------------|------------|------------|-------|
| Geth   | 1.9.24  | Nov 2020 | Dell R420   | ~ 24 hours | default    | 3.5 days to generate snapshot on 1.10.0 |
| Geth   | 1.10.1  | Mar 2021 | Homebrew Xeon | ~ 10 hours | default  | snapshot sync; 3.5 days to generate snapshot; 3 hours to offline prune |
| Geth   | 1.9.25  | Jan 2021 | Contabo L VPS | ~ 24 hours | default  | 2 weeks to generate snapshot on 1.10.0 |
| Nethermind | 1.10.7-beta | Jan 2021 | Contabo L VPS | Never | default | VPS IOPS too low to finish Nethermind sync |
| Nethermind | 1.10.44 | Mar 2021 | Homebrew Xeon | ~ 27 hours | default | |
| Nethermind | 1.10.9 | Jan 2021 | Netcup VPS 2000 G9 | ~ 20 hours | default | |
| Besu | 20.10.4 | Jan 2020 | Homebrew Xeon | ~ 6 days 8 hours | default | |
